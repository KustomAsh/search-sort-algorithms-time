# search-sort-algorithms-time
The program takes input data from file and performs binary and linear search on sorted and unsorted array 
and prints the time taken by each algorithm in milliseconds.

 Implement linear search and Binary search algorithm in C++. Given an input file containing any (1000 random) numbers of space 
 separated integers as input. The first line will tell the number of integer entries and in the next line it will have the data.
 For Binary search first sort the data using Bubble, selection sort and insertion sort algorithm and save the sorted data in 
 Bubble_sorted.txt, Selection_sorted.txt and Insertion_sorted.txt respectively. Each file will contain time consumed in milliseconds
 by the respective algorithm in the first line and in the next line result of algorithm.
